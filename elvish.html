After entering the house, he met his Youtuber friend Fukra Insaan and hugged him but later a small conflict happened between both of them, as this is expected. Also Bigg Boss will try to manipulate some things between them to make them lose the award but it will be challenging for him to win over Fukra Insaan in the show.
